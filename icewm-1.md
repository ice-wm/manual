Introduction
============

This document is the manual for the **IceWM** X11 window manager.
The IceWM manpages provide additional documentation.

The goal of IceWM is to provide a small, fast and familiar window manager for the X11 window system, which is compatible with the EWMH and ICCCM window manager protocols. Generally, it tries to make all functions available both by keyboard and by mouse (this is not currently possible when using mouse focus).

IceWM originally was designed to emulate the look of Motif, OS/2 Warp 4, OS/2 Warp 3 and Windows 95. Since it has a theming engine others styles are possible. A large number of original themes have been created and [published by users](https://themes.ice-wm.org).

Further information can be found at [the IceWM website](https://ice-wm.org),
at the [current site of development](https://github.com/bbidulock/icewm/),
which includes the [support requests](https://github.com/bbidulock/icewm/issues/).
